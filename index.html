Solar Water Heating uses solar collectors and copper pipes to capture up to 80% of the daytime heat falling on your roof, and turn it into hot water for sinks, showers, and laundry.</p>
                                <p class="flow-text">Solar Water Heating not only saves you money, it also helps meet energy efficiency requirements for Title 24, LEED, and other green building programs.

                                <p class="flow-text">Energy Storage is the next exciting frontier in sustainability. To increase resiliency, get the most out of your Solar PV systems, or simply keep the lights on during an emergency, Promise Energy can integrate energy storage solutions on both new and existing projects.
                                </p>
                                <p class="flow-text">All of our systems are battery ready!
                                </p>
                                <p class="flow-text"> We can help you determine the optimal sizing and technology option for energy storage, and understand the economic value it will bring. Energy storage can increase resiliency during power outages or emergencies by providing energy to vital systems like refrigeration, emergency lighting, internet access, and phone charging. You can also save money by shifting consumption away from peak time-of-use pricing, and reducing demand charges. Emerging programs for demand response and ancillary grid services can also help you maximize ROI.
                                </p>
                                <p class="flow-text"> As a Promise Energy standard, we also include a premium energy management solution called naak with every project. naak is a hardware and software system that uses AI to optimize your solar pv + battery system. naak acts like a brain – monitoring and controlling production, consumption and storage - and automating your savings. Because it can think, you're protected even when rate tariffs or consumption patterns change in the future.

                                <p class="flow-text">Promise Energy was engaged by Gonzalez-Goodale architects to assist the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering in preparing complete Design Engineering documents for a 391 KW photovoltaic (PV) solar system at the new Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) Bus Maintenance and CNG Fueling Facility located in the downtown Los Angeles adjacent to Union Station. This complicated project involves three types of solar arrays including on the roof of the proposed Bus Maintenance and Operations Building; carport arrays over the top deck of the two-level Parking Structure; as well as solar canopies over the bus service and bus vaulting area.

                                </p>
                                <blockquote>Our expanded design will result in the facility being “Net Zero Energy” – a first for LADOT.</blockquote>
                                <p class="flow-text">Promise Energy was able to expand the proposed system size to provide nearly five (5) times more PV panels for the project because of our expertise in rooftop-scale solar design. Additionally, we were able to dramatically reduce the project’s structural engineering budget with the use of innovative “busport” solar arrays which saved the project millions of dollars compared to the initial proposed design.</p>
                                <p class="flow-text">Based on the significant results we accomplished during the Design Phase of the project, Promise Energy was also engaged to provide Construction Management services for the project. Our Construction Management services include: preparing and reviewing bid documents; responding to RFI’s; approving installer shop drawings and submittals; overseeing installation; and system commissioning and performance verification.
